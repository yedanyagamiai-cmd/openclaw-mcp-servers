## Named Protocols

### BattleCard Protocol -- Side-by-Side Comparison Engine
Generates structured comparison matrices for 2-5 AI coding tools across 7 dimensions: code generation quality, debugging capabilities, refactoring power, chat interface, terminal integration, multi-file editing, and autonomous agent mode. Each dimension is rated 1-10 with a summary verdict.

### DeepProfile Protocol -- Comprehensive Tool Dossier
Builds a complete profile for any single tool: description, all pricing tiers (free/pro/enterprise), supported AI models, IDE integrations, key features, strengths, weaknesses, best-for scenarios, alternatives, and recent changelog highlights. Think of it as the "Wirecutter review" for AI tools.

### Arsenal Protocol -- Category Browser
Organizes all 15+ tracked tools into categories: IDE-integrated assistants, CLI-based agents, cloud agents, code review tools, and specialized tools (testing, docs, security). Each category includes tool count, top picks, and quick comparison notes.

### MatchMaker Protocol -- AI Recommendation Engine (Pro)
Takes your use case description, team size, monthly budget, must-have features, and preferred IDE, then returns top 3 tools ranked by match score with detailed reasoning, tradeoffs, and migration tips from your current setup.

### CostRadar Protocol -- Total Cost Calculator (Pro)
Computes monthly and annual costs for any tool configuration: team seats, plan tier, estimated usage (requests/day), and add-ons. Returns per-developer cost and automatically compares against alternatives at the same scale.

## Wrong vs. Right

### Example 1: Too Many Tools in One Comparison

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Compare all AI coding tools"
Agent: [calls compare_tools with 12 tools]  // Unwieldy, unreadable output
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Compare all AI coding tools"
Agent: "There are 15+ tools tracked. Let me help narrow it down. Are you looking for:
  - IDE-integrated (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot)?
  - CLI-based (Claude Code, Aider)?
  - Cloud agents (Devin, Replit)?
Pick a category and I'll compare the top 2-3."
```

### Example 2: Stale Pricing Assumptions

**Wrong:**
```
User: "How much is Cursor?"
Agent: "Cursor Pro is $20/mo."  // Recalled from training data, may be outdated
```

**Right:**
```
User: "How much is Cursor?"
Agent: [calls get_tool_profile("Cursor")]  // Gets latest tracked pricing
Agent: "According to our latest data (updated weekly), Cursor Pro is $20/mo. Always verify on cursor.com for flash sales or plan changes."
```

### Example 3: Recommendation Without Context

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Which AI tool should I use?"
Agent: [calls get_recommendations with empty fields]  // Garbage in, garbage out
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Which AI tool should I use?"
Agent: "To give you a good recommendation, I need a few details:
  1. What are you building? (web app, mobile, data science, etc.)
  2. Team size? (solo, small team, enterprise)
  3. Monthly budget per developer?
  4. Must-have features? (agent mode, multi-file editing, etc.)
  5. Preferred IDE? (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, etc.)"
```
