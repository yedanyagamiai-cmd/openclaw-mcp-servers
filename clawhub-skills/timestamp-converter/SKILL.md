# OpenClaw Timestamp Converter v2.0

**Never fight with timezones again. 5 tools. 400+ zones. DST-aware. Sub-100ms.**

| Tool | Purpose | Free |
|------|---------|------|
| `convert_timestamp` | Epoch/ISO/RFC/human-readable conversion | Yes |
| `timezone_convert` | Cross-timezone translation with DST | Yes |
| `duration_calc` | Date math, business days, age calc | Yes |
| `list_timezones` | Search 400+ IANA zones by city/offset | Yes |
| `relative_time` | "3 hours ago" / "in 2 days" output | Yes |

## What's New in v2.0

- **ChronoEdge Protocol** — All conversions run on Cloudflare's edge network. Global sub-100ms, no cold starts.
- **400+ IANA Zones** — Full timezone database with DST transition dates, historical offsets, and abbreviation mapping.
- **BusinessDay Engine** — Duration calculations that skip weekends, handle leap years, and support custom holiday calendars.
- **AutoDetect Parser** — Pass any timestamp format (epoch seconds, epoch millis, ISO 8601, RFC 2822, natural language). We figure it out.

## Quick Start

```json
{
  "openclaw-timestamp": {
    "type": "streamable-http",
    "url": "https://timestamp-converter-mcp.yagami8095.workers.dev/mcp"
  }
}
```

Add to Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, or any MCP-compatible client. Zero install. Works immediately.

## Detection Triggers

This skill activates when a user says any of these:
- "convert timestamp", "epoch to date", "what time is 1709827200", "Unix to human readable"
- "what time is it in Tokyo", "convert PST to JST", "translate meeting time"
- "calculate duration", "how many days between", "time difference", "add 3 weeks to today"
- "list timezones", "UTC offset for", "what timezone is Sydney in", "IANA timezone"
- "time ago", "relative time", "how long ago was March 1", "when was 1700000000"
- "ISO 8601", "milliseconds to date", "RFC 2822", "business days between"

## Named Protocols

### ChronoEdge Protocol
All timestamp parsing and conversion runs on Cloudflare Workers' edge network. No cold start, no server round-trip. Average response under 50ms worldwide.

### AutoDetect Parser
Pass any timestamp format and the tool identifies it automatically:
- `1709827200` -- detected as Unix epoch (seconds)
- `1709827200000` -- detected as Unix epoch (milliseconds)
- `"2024-03-07T12:00:00Z"` -- detected as ISO 8601
- `"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 12:00:00 GMT"` -- detected as RFC 2822
- `"March 7, 2024 3pm"` -- detected as natural language

### BusinessDay Engine
Duration calculations that understand the real world: skip weekends, account for leap years and leap seconds, support configurable work-week definitions.

## Tools (5)

### `convert_timestamp` -- Universal Timestamp Conversion
Convert between Unix epoch (seconds or milliseconds), ISO 8601, RFC 2822, and human-readable formats. AutoDetect Parser identifies your input format automatically.

**Input:** any timestamp format
**Output:** all major formats simultaneously -- epoch, ISO, RFC, human-readable, day of week, week number, day of year

**Wrong / Right:**

```
WRONG: "Convert 1709827200 to a date" then manually parsing the epoch in your head
RIGHT: convert_timestamp({ timestamp: "1709827200" })
       -> { iso: "2024-03-07T16:00:00Z", human: "Thursday, March 7, 2024 4:00 PM UTC", epoch_ms: 1709827200000, week: 10, dayOfYear: 67 }

WRONG: Guessing whether 1709827200000 is seconds or milliseconds
RIGHT: AutoDetect Parser recognizes 13-digit = milliseconds, 10-digit = seconds. Always correct.
```

### `timezone_convert` -- Cross-Timezone Translation
Convert a specific date-time from one timezone to another. Fully DST-aware with transition date reporting.

**Input:** datetime + source timezone + one or more target timezones
**Output:** converted times with UTC offsets, DST status, abbreviations, and next DST transition date

**Wrong / Right:**

```
WRONG: timezone_convert({ time: "3pm", from: "EST", to: "JST" })
       -> Ambiguous! EST could mean US Eastern or Australian Eastern. Use IANA names.
RIGHT: timezone_convert({ time: "2024-03-07T15:00:00", from: "America/New_York", to: "Asia/Tokyo" })
       -> { converted: "2024-03-08T05:00:00+09:00", dst: false, abbreviation: "JST", utcOffset: "+09:00" }

WRONG: Forgetting DST transitions when scheduling across timezones
RIGHT: The tool reports next DST transition date, so you know if the time will shift next week
```

### `duration_calc` -- Time Arithmetic
Calculate the exact duration between two dates/times, or add/subtract a duration from a date.

**Returns:** breakdown in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds -- plus total in each unit
**Supports:** business days mode (weekends excluded), leap year awareness, ISO 8601 duration format (P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S)

**Wrong / Right:**

```
WRONG: Manually counting days between dates and forgetting February has 28/29 days
RIGHT: duration_calc({ from: "2024-01-15", to: "2024-03-07" })
       -> { days: 52, businessDays: 38, breakdown: { months: 1, days: 21 } }

WRONG: Adding "30 days" when you mean "1 month" (they differ across months)
RIGHT: duration_calc({ from: "2024-01-31", add: "P1M" }) -> "2024-02-29" (leap year aware)
```

### `list_timezones` -- IANA Timezone Database
Browse and search the complete IANA timezone database (400+ entries). Find timezone by city, country, or offset.

**Search:** fuzzy match by city name ("Tokyo"), country code ("JP"), or offset ("UTC+9")
**Returns:** IANA name, current UTC offset, DST status, next transition date, common abbreviation

### `relative_time` -- Human-Friendly Time
Convert any timestamp to natural language relative time expressions.

**Supports:** past ("3 hours ago") and future ("in 2 days"), configurable granularity
**AutoDetect:** pass epoch, ISO, or human-readable date strings -- format is auto-identified

## Security & Privacy

- **No data storage** -- Timestamps are processed in-memory on Cloudflare Workers and never written to disk or database.
- **No logging of input** -- Your timestamps, meeting times, and date calculations are not logged or recorded.
- **Edge isolation** -- Each request runs in an isolated V8 isolate on Cloudflare's edge. No shared state between requests.
- **No external calls** -- All timezone data is embedded in the worker. No third-party API calls during processing.
- **HTTPS only** -- All connections are TLS 1.3 encrypted. HTTP requests are rejected, not redirected.
